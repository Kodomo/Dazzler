Dazzler
===
A BOINC Account manager, for managing groups of hosts as a single farm.  It is not thought as a replacement for a common BAM, but a way to ease the managament of medium/large groups of hosts working in several projects, managed by their owners. 

Inspired from: http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VirtualCampusSupercomputerCenter
