Dazzler
=======
This document describes the process to install and configure Dazzler.


Requirements
============
The following software/library are required to work with Dazzler:

* Apache
* PHP 5+
* PHP-psql
* Postgres

* Ext-JS 3 (3.3.0)
* Ext-JS UX
* TDGi.iconMgr
* famfam icons

Preparing the server
====================

* You should first determine wich will be your *BAM_URL* (http://BAM_URL/). This value is important because the signing keys are linked to it, and it cannot be modified once started attaching hosts.
* Setup a site (or a virtualhost), for the BAM_URL.
* Create a postgres database
* Create a pair of keys for the BAM. (see bamadmin	http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/KeySetup )

NOTE: Dazzler it's preset to operate in /BAM, so the BAM url is really http://BAM_URL/BAM. This allow the admin, to create content for the BAM manually or using a content management system (like Wordpress). But if you dont like that, the easier way is to redirect traffic from / to /BAM.


Installation process
====================

* Download dazzler source code. And copy/unzip/link it to the prepared site root. a BAM directory should be present in the root.
* Download and setup the libraries. A prepared package can be found at ext.tar.bz2. If you choose to use it, unzip it *in* the BAM directory. 
* Setup the database. First BAM/conf/db_base.sql and then BAM/conf/db_dazzler.sql.
* Edit the sample configuration file to suit your needs.  Ext/library related info don't need modification if the prepared package was used.
* Login to the BAM with your web browser in: http://BAM_URL/BAM . Default admin account it's bamadmin:dazzler . This account shouldn't be used for managing hosts, and for *OBVIOUS* reasons the password must be changued inmediatly.
* Setup the periodic task : 0 * * * * /path/to/dazzler/BAM/cron/crontasks.sh
